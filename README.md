# Google News Search
Google News Search using React, MongoDB, Node, Express

## How it Works
This application pulls articles from the Google News Search API. Users can search articles based on a topic/keywords of interest.

Articles can be saved, allowing users to run another search or return to the site at a later time while still having easy access to the stories that piqued their interest.
